ðŸ”§ Step 1: Fix Go Dependency Issue (go.sum)

Go modules are not downloaded correctly.

cd /artifacts/src/github.com/fabcar/go
go mod tidy
go mod vendor

Then uncomment this line in your script:
#presetup



âœ… Once You Fix That
After applying all these, run this:
docker-compose -f ./artifacts/docker-compose.yaml down -v
docker volume prune -f
docker-compose -f ./artifacts/docker-compose.yaml up -d
./deployChaincode.sh
