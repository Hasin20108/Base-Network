The Problem is solved by uninstalling existing docker engine and installing the latest version of docker engine

chatgpt solution 
## step 1-6 for docker install 
1. sudo apt remove -y docker docker.io containerd containerd.io
2. sudo apt autoremove -y
3. curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo bash
4. docker --version
5. docker compose version
6. docker run hello-world

=================================== Reply from Chatgpt ==========================
Chatgpt:
The output of docker info indicates that your Docker client is installed and working, but it cannot communicate with the Docker daemon. Specifically:
This error generally means the Docker daemon (server process) is not running, or your current user doesn't have permission to access the Docker socket.

✅ Good news: The Docker daemon (dockerd) is running. So this isn't a problem with the daemon failing to start.
But the fact that docker info still can't connect suggests:

docker-compose -f ./artifacts/docker-compose.yaml down -v
docker volume prune -f
docker-compose -f ./artifacts/docker-compose.yaml up -d

====================reason of solution=======================================
So even though your docker-compose.yaml was technically correct, Docker’s internal state (specifically volume metadata) was wrong, likely from earlier experiments or mount attempts.

Cleaning it out forced Docker to mount your genesis.block file cleanly, treating it correctly as a file — not a directory — and the error disappeared.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker-compose down -v` | Deleted all containers **and their attached volumes** (not just stopping them)      |
| `docker volume prune -f` | Removed any **leftover anonymous or dangling volumes** that Docker still remembered |
| `docker-compose up -d`   | Created everything fresh, with **no stale volume conflicts**                        |
